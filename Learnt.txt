Part 1 :

Git:

how to clone the repository from the GitHub to git

how to add a new file - add to staging area- To commit- to push origin main

Insert -> Add-> Commit->Push->Pull(GitHub to git)

Part 2 :

- Now How to create folder and files manually in the local directory

- Folder contains some files like index.html  and style.css and all.

- Now those file will be untracked U 

- We should make this folder to be got folder, then only those file are tracked.

- To Make the folder git folder --> We should create local repository .

- steps to create the repository -> "git init" cmd

- Then the files will be tracked, After the as usual we can make the file to staging area by using "git add."->"git commit -m "message" -> "
-- important  note--

Next will pushing process. 

---We need to connect this local repository to the remote git hub to push:

- So Create the repository in GitHub like "Githubemc2". Take the url HTTPS.

- Then use this cmd "git remote add origin https://github.com/M-JohnsonDavid/githubemc2.git"


- Check "git branch"- > It will shows master. But there will be main only bcoz git master updated to main.

- So we need to change the name using "git branch -M main"

- Now you push - cmd "git push origin main" It will work fine
